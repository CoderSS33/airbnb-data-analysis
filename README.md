# Approach
```Data Collection```: Clone the airbnb data from your local directory. 

```Data Cleaning```: Refine pre-processing methods like Data handling is applied to the collected data.

```Statistical Analysis```: Cleaned numerical data has been analysed to get a valuable insights.

```EDA Analysis```: The cleaned data has been analyzed using various exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, revealing insights into current trends.

```Setup the Streamlit app```: Streamlit is a user-friendly web development tool that simplifies the process of creating intuitive interfaces.

```Data Analysis```: Cleaned data has been analyzed and visualized in Streamlit through Pandas DataFrame.

```Data Visualization```: Cleaned data has been visualized using Plotly to gain valuable insights from the datasets.

```Setup Powerbi dashboard```: The cleaned data has been analyzed and visualized using an interactive Power BI dashboard.

The provided code utilizes Python scripting along with various libraries to fetch data from the our local directory. Data manipulation techniques are then applied, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the cleaned dataset to extract meaningful insights. Furthermore, the implementation includes a Streamlit web application to enhance user engagement and create an intuitive dashboard in PowerBi.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:
- Importing all the neccessary libraries includes ```Streamlit``` which creates UI to interact with user and display the analysed data, ```Pandas``` which helps to display the analysed data in Streamlit web,```numpy``` which will help in mathematical conversion,```Plotly```  is employed to visualize the data and gain insights from it,```OS``` assists in reading data from the local directory,```JSON``` is used to load JSON files into Python,```Scipy``` aids in conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and extracting valuable insights.
```bash
import os
import pandas as pd
import json
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as stats
import streamlit as st
import plotly.express as px
from plotly.subplots import make_subplots
import plotly.graph_objects as go
```
- ```Datacoll_dataclean``` file is responsible for fetching data from the local directory and performing necessary data cleaning operations. **Note: Replace your actual path in ```path```**
```bash
path = r"please provide the path"
```
- ```eda_analysis``` file is responsible for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and extracting valuable insights.
- ```Dataextract_visual``` file is used to extract the data stored in MySQL and visualize it to derive valuable insights using Plotly.
- Five separate tabs have been implemented in the Streamlit web application to facilitate user interaction and enhance data visualization for insightful analysis.
```bash
tab1, tab2, tab3, tab4,tab5,tab6= st.tabs(["Home", "Geo visualization", " Website","Statistical Insights","EDA Insights","Data visualization"])
```
- In Tab1 of the Streamlit web application, user can select type of ```Country``` and ```No of people``` for which they need to visualize the data in Geo visualization.
- In Tab2 of the Streamlit web application, the user-input location will be displayed using Geo visualization.
- In Tab3, the Streamlit web application mimics the layout and functionality of the Airbnb website using the cleaned data, providing users with an interactive experience similar to browsing Airbnb listings.
- In Tab4, Cleaned data has undergone Statistical analysis procedure to get a valuable insights.
- In Tab5, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted on the dataset to extract valuable insights, which are then presented to the user for further analysis and interpretation.
- In Tab6, Cleaned data has been analyzed, and visualized to extract valuable insights.


This Python script streamlines the process of fetching data from a local directory, implementing crucial data cleaning procedures, and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract valuable insights. This comprehensive approach empowers users to gain valuable insights and make informed decisions based on the visualized data.
